TECHNOLOGIES USED:

I decided to create this application using a RESTful API in JSON. I used React as a front-end technology, and Node.js as a back-end technology. I used Sequelize as an ORM. I did not use any boilerplate code in this project.
For testing, I used Jasmine for the back-end testing.
I chose to use these two technologies because I have had a little bit of experience with each one before, and they work well together for a full stack application.

This was my first time working with this type of architecture. I have had some practice with both React and Node.js on their own on a simpler scale, but I struggled to understand how to combine the two at first. I am more familiar with Node.js having done my capstone with this technology than I am with React.


PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS:

Understanding Basic Architecture:
    I had to learn how React and Node.js connect and communicate in this type of architecture. I did research on the architecture and familiarized myself with fetch calls and json, which I had not previously encountered.

    Working on the actual project, I had issues connecting the front end to the back end in practice. I added console.log statements to figure out what portion of my application was the issue. I narrowed it down to the fetch calls, which I am still struggling with.

Finding a way to route between components in React:
    In the past, I have used React Router to route components. In this application, I chose to approach in a different manner and used state to define our current section and determine what to display.


WHAT WOULD I DO DIFFERENTLY?

I would have familiarized myself with the architechture more and done some basic things before starting a full fledged application. It felt very challenging to have to figure out the architecture and implement features in such a short time.
If I had had additional time, I would have added some of the bonus features suggested. I think it would have been great to be able to add the list functionality so that a user could create multiple lists instead of just adding an removing items.
