I decided to create this application using a RESTFUL API, with React as the front end technology and Node.js as the back end technology. I used Sequelize as an ORM.
This was my first time working with this type of architecture. I have worked with React alone and Node.js alone but I haven't worked with both together before and haven't done anything quite as complex as this before.

React-done a few simple projects
Node.js-more experience with this technology



trying to figure out why backend and front end aren't connecting =>
    added console.log statements to figure out what is hitting where and find out where we are stopping
    discovered that the front end and the backend aren't connecting, issue is the fetch call
        looked up documentation
        tried to change based on research
        cannot resolve, but with help could figure it out

User Sign Up isn't pulling data from the form to User Component

Edit item => need to find a way to route the actual item to the edit page
